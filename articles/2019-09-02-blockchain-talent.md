Old article. This applies to the full text interview of CSDN Blockchain Camp on June 26, 2018. Although more than a year has passed, I think the viewpoints in it are still useful.

#### 1. In the recruitment of blockchain technical talent, what skills are you lacking the most? For this type of technical talent, how high a salary will be given?

Embracing blockchain has become mainstream in the current industry. A large number of industries need to use blockchain technology to solve pain points and problems, and further improve industry operational efficiency. In this process, composite talents who not only understand industry domain knowledge but are also familiar with industry application technology architecture, and have a profound understanding of blockchain technology are most needed.

For example, in supply chain finance, architects need to have rich knowledge of supply chain finance business, know the architecture and processes of supply chain finance systems like the back of their hand, and also have a deep understanding of blockchain technology, so that they can use blockchain technology to transform existing applications to improve the efficiency of supply chain finance.

The salary depends on the experience and ability of the personnel, ranging from 30,000 to 50,000.
​
#### 2. After talent is recruited, roughly how long is the adaptation or training period before they can truly carry out tasks?

The training period for different talents is different. Generally speaking, the more technical accumulation and the more sensitive to technology, the shorter the adaptation or training period required. Generally speaking, they can understand basic blockchain knowledge and carry out blockchain-related work about 2 months after joining.
For some concepts in the original centralized system, such as system time, transactions, logs, etc., the usage in blockchain is quite different. Therefore, in addition to learning basic blockchain knowledge, technical personnel also need to change their thinking mode in work and adopt blockchain best practices to complete their work.

#### 3. If a technical intern has a technical foundation but no relevant blockchain skills, roughly how long does it take to learn and skillfully carry out blockchain-related tasks?

If it's just doing blockchain applications, such as DApps, then an intern can independently develop a simpler DApp after studying for about 3 months.

#### 4. Programmers have job classifications, such as front-end, back-end, architect... Is there a rough classification for blockchain technical talent?

From the perspective of blockchain technology, it is also divided into underlying development, blockchain middleware development, blockchain smart contract development, and blockchain business docking development.

#### 5. What are the core skills required for different blockchain talents? Is there a big difference in salary for different types of blockchain talents, and what are the differences?

Underlying development technical personnel need solid cryptography skills, broad basic computer knowledge (such as operating system principles, network knowledge, data structures, algorithms, etc.) and profound programming experience (at least proficient in a system programming language, such as C/C++, GO, etc.).
Blockchain middleware developers need to have comprehensive blockchain knowledge and a deep understanding of the implementation methods, pros and cons of different blockchains; for example, Bitcoin uses the UTXO model, while Ethereum uses the account model, and their handling in docking is completely different.
Blockchain smart contract developers need to be proficient in smart contract languages, have a deep understanding of common design patterns and implementation methods of smart contracts, understand the business to be implemented very well, and understand smart contract security very well; for example, taking the currently most popular Token contract, one needs to understand the business flow and logic of Token transfer and issuance, need to use secure programming means to avoid overflow vulnerabilities and logic vulnerabilities, and need to research best practices for permission control implementation, so that the developed smart contract can meet business needs and ensure contract security.
Blockchain business docking developers need to understand certain blockchain knowledge, understand business knowledge, understand what blockchain can do and what it cannot do. For example, blockchain has the characteristic of being immutable once written, so in which link of the business process of this industry can this characteristic be used to obtain better results? These are all problems that business docking developers need to consider.

#### 6. Is the salary of blockchain technical talent relatively flat, inflated, or slightly lower compared to AI or traditional industry programmers?

Blockchain is currently a hot topic, so the salary of blockchain technical talent is slightly higher than that of AI or traditional industry programmers.

#### 7. Which directions of traditional programmer talent are easier to switch to blockchain? Which directions of traditional programmers are more willing to switch to blockchain? Why?

Judging from the current situation, traditional programmers in P2P/communication software development, encryption system development, and database software development are easier to switch to underlying chain development.
Back-end technical developers are easier to switch to middleware and smart contract development. The main reason is that original technical accumulation can help programmers get started quickly.

#### 8. If you want to transition to blockchain, from a practical point of view, where do you need to work hard to truly make a good transition?

First of all, you need to understand the basic knowledge of blockchain, cryptography, P2P, data structures, etc. Secondly, you need to deeply understand the ideas of blockchain.
Furthermore, use the blockchain SDK or interface for application development, and deepen understanding in actual development.

#### 9. Can you introduce two programmers who have transitioned from other industries to blockchain that you know?

I transferred from financial industry system development to middleware and smart contract development. My colleague transferred from front-end development to middleware development. Transitioning from financial industry system to smart contract development will have some advantages relative to other industries, because current blockchain applications are mainly related to finance, and some thinking in the financial industry can help you understand the essence of blockchain very well. Transitioning from front-end development to middleware and DApp development also has good advantages. For example, the most mature Ethereum client is now web3.js, so front-end developers can get started quickly, not to mention that the DApp interface is originally developed using html and css.

#### 10. Do you currently feel that there is a significant transition wave happening, or are traditional programmers just waiting and seeing, and not really willing to step in, and the transition wave is far from coming?

Now blockchain landing applications are still in the exploration stage, and no killer application has appeared, so there is no obvious transition wave. It's just some programmers who are interested in new technologies and eager to do something interesting are entering the blockchain industry.

#### 11. How scarce is blockchain talent? Can you give an example?

Let's put it this way, even among programmers who should be exposed to emerging technologies very quickly, many people do not understand blockchain. And now many industries want to do some applications on blockchain, so most people only have ideas and cannot implement them. When technical personnel are interviewed now, most people have only heard of blockchain, and mainly know Bitcoin. People who truly understand the underlying and principles of blockchain are rare.

#### 12. Others, what special points do you think are worth mentioning for blockchain talent?

Blockchain is not just technology, but also an architectural method, an idea; blockchain technology and exploration are changing with each passing day, so blockchain talents are advised to learn more, think more, and practice more.
