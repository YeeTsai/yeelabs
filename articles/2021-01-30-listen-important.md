> At that moment, I understood that if I wanted to succeed in my career and life, I had to practice the skill of listening; not just listening occasionally, but listening all the time; not just listening to him, but listening to the team, customers, and all stakeholders. I should exchange opinions more and defend my own views less—if I want to leave my mark, I need to develop this skill. Now, I have several subordinates reporting directly to me, and their opinions are as important as mine. I need to let go of the reins, stop proving my own value and point of view, and pay more attention to others' ideas. Because simply having strong abilities and expertise is not enough.
> -- Maureen Chiquet, "Deep Thinking"

After waking up naturally at 7 this morning, I picked up "Deep Thinking," which I had only read a few pages of intermittently in the past few days. I spent more than half an hour flipping through most of it and felt that reading in the morning was quite efficient.

The quote above is a passage from the book, which touched me deeply. I have a habit of interrupting others, and I have always been trying to change it, but progress is always slow. If you instinctively feel that you are right and others are wrong, you will definitely not listen to others properly. Listening is not just hearing; many people appear to be listening, but deep down they are constantly resisting. The inner monologue is: "This person knows nothing, yet they are making irresponsible remarks," etc. Whether interrupting others or just listening superficially while resisting internally, it is caused by not being open and confident enough. In fact, thinking this way might be better: regardless of whether what others say is right or wrong, the details you didn't consider in their speech might inspire you and perfect your train of thought, thereby improving you. In this way, you gain something. Therefore, from the perspective of personal improvement, one should listen more to others' suggestions and ideas, change if there are mistakes, and encourage oneself if there are none, so as to continuously improve and progress.

Self-encouragement.
