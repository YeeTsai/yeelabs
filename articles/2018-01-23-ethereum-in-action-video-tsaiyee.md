This is my speech at the Blockchain Technology Developer Salon [3rd Issue] hosted by CSDN on January 21, 2018. It introduced Ethereum development methods from multiple dimensions such as Ethereum history, wallet usage, Solidity smart contract development, and DApp development. Participants learned the ERC20 development specification and smart contract development ideas starting from the simplest HelloWorld. Finally, a practical case - Pet Shop demonstration was successfully carried out on site, allowing the audience to experience the magic of blockchain development.
