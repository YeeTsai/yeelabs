If you are tired of WordPress, or if you are a Coder who likes to tinker, then you should use Jekyll and GitHub to build your own Blog. You can commit your written Blog to GitHub just like submitting code, and then access it through your own domain name or GitHub's subdomain.

## Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator.

```
Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.
```

## GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://github.io) is a page hosting service.

```
Websites for you and your projects.
Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
```


Fortunately, GitHub Pages supports Jekyll.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight "markup language".

```
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
```

You can easily write documents with beautiful layouts using Atom or Vi.

## Trap

If you follow most online tutorials, install Jekyll on your local machine, write Markdown files, check the display effect locally, and then upload to GitHub. Then congratulations, you will find that the page that displays well locally does not display as well on GitHub Pages.

This is because the Jekyll used by GitHub Pages has significant differences in Markdown syntax from the official Jekyll, so it is strongly recommended to use the GitHub Pages local environment for testing instead of using the official Jekyll engine.
